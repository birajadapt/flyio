# Steps

1. See the code and fly.toml file. Also note that the [forked aioice repo](https://github.com/xAlpha8/aioice/commit/acc6422f230a09d2d501723937e220ddbba75df1) is being used. Both HTTP and UDP should run on port 8080.

2. launch. **When it asked if we need a dedicated IP, say yes.**

   ```
   fly launch --org sahil-manocha-115
   ```

3. Used the URL I got in outspeed-js local playground to connect to the server.
